# 👋 Hi, I'm Lawrence – Visionary Founder & Innovator Behind Zurispace

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a startup founder passionate about building inclusive, tech-driven solutions that prioritize mental wellness, community, and human connection.

### 🚀 Currently Building: Zurispace
**Zurispace** is a community-based mental wellness platform that empowers people to affirm, connect, and transform. It’s not just another mental health app — it’s a social and emotional ecosystem built around human-centered experiences.

- 🌱 **Mission:** To make mental well-being accessible, interactive, and empowering for everyone, especially in African communities where stigma still lingers.
- 🔗 **Core Features:**
  - A TikTok-style feed for affirmations and positive content (“Zuri Vibes”)
  - A therapy booking platform connecting users to licensed professionals
  - Challenge-based growth hubs to promote personal development
  - Community groups for healing, mindset growth, and accountability
- 🧠 **Built for:** People seeking safe, inclusive, and engaging digital spaces to grow mentally and emotionally — with tech as the enabler, not the distraction.

### 🧭 My Vision as a Founder
While I may not be a traditional software engineer, I bring:
- 🔍 A **clear founder-market fit**, driven by real-world experience and personal passion for mental wellness
- 🧩 A talent for assembling multidisciplinary teams and translating ideas into actionable roadmaps
- 📈 A strategic mindset that blends community, technology, and social impact

I strongly believe in tech that **amplifies humanity**, not replaces it.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On
- 🧪 Validating Zurispace’s MVP through content, UX feedback, and low-code tools
- 🤝 Building partnerships with therapists, coaches, and mental wellness advocates
- 📊 Learning automation tools (e.g. [n8n](https://n8n.io)) and data analytics to supercharge product development
- 📚 Learning Git, GitHub, and the basics of product dev to grow as a tech-enabled founder

### 💡 Side Projects & Goals
- Launching a **YouTube series** to share stories of healing and hope — eventually powering user-generated content for Zurispace
- Creating a **Founder's Log** to document the ups and downs of building a startup from scratch
- Exploring ways to integrate **AI and automation** to scale impact, not just features

### 🔍 What You'll Find Here
Even if I'm not pushing code daily, this space reflects my journey:
- 📁 Startup documentation, pitch decks, and public roadmaps
- 🧠 Mental wellness ideas, frameworks, and growth content
